# Garage-Management-system

The **Vehicle Management System** is a Python-based project that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**. It simulates a real-world garage where different types of vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck) are managed dynamically.

---

# Features
- Abstract class `Vehicle` with methods:
  - `start()`
  - `stop()`
  - `fuelEfficiency()`
- Subclasses:
  - **Car** – Fuel efficiency: 12–18 km/l
  - **Bike** – Fuel efficiency: 35–60 km/l
  - **Truck** – Fuel efficiency: 4–8 km/l
- **Polymorphism:** Execute the same methods on different vehicle types with unique behaviors.
- Console-based simulation of a garage system.
